- ## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning based web application that classifies an input sentence into academic subjects such as Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Math, and Computer Science.

The model is trained using balanced datasets and uses TF-IDF vectorization with a Naive Bayes classifier. Flask is used to connect the machine learning model with a web-based frontend.

  `Algorithms solve problems efficiently`
